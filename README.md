# Pawpularity-Contest

This is Pawpularity Contest on Kaggle. While on army me and a dear friend of mine @BillNas wanted to kill our time and do something productive so we joined this Kaggle Competition.

To Do:
1.  See correlation of Tags and Pawpularity and keep only the usefull ones!
2.  Use Transfer Learning and get a better model like ResNet!
3.  Add more tags to the dataset by using a pretrained model of classification
4.  Try common techniques for dealing with imbalanced data like:
  *  Class weighting
  *  Oversampling
5.  Try different Learning Rates and Optimizers
